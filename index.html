            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term.. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners,
                skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.[9][28][7] More person-centered
                definitions focus.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many thick and prescriptive conceptions base their account on the aims
                of education, i.e. regarding the goals that the activity of education tries to achieve.[24][25][26]
                These aims are sometimes categorized into epistemic goods, like knowledge and understanding, skills,
                like rationality and critical thinking, and character traits, like kindness and honesty.[20] Some
                theorists focus on one overarching purpose of education and see the more specific aims as means to this
                end.[27][25] This can take the form of socialization, in which accumulated knowledge is transmitted from
                one generation to the next with the goal of helping the student function as a regular citizen in
                society.[9][28][7] More person-centered definitions focus.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is commonly subdivided into different types. The most common
                subdivision is between formal, non-formal, and informal education.[35][36][7][37] However, some
                theorists only distinguish between formal and informal education.[38] A process of teaching constitutes
                formal education if it happens in a complex institutionalized framework. Such frameworks are usually
                chronologically and hierarchically organized as in modern schooling systems, which have different
                classes based on the student's age and progress, all the way from primary school to university. Because
                of its scale, formal education is usually controlled and guided by a governmental entity and is normally
                compulsory up to a certain age.[35][39] Non-formal. </p>
